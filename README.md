## Inspiration üß†:

Owing to the current (COVID) situation it is essential to have a system, which has minimum contact, for attendance. Biometric attendance possesses the risk of spreading bacteria among its users. So in the pursuit of a solution, we came up with an idea of taking attendance with the help of a camera sensor. The current systems were capable of processing only one user's request at a time, which was very inefficient. Hence the inspiration came from the pursuit of a solution for no contact attendance system.

## Technologies Usedüõ†

####  üêçPython-Django

#### üì±Android 

#### ‚ú®Firebase

#### üëÅGoogle Vision API

## Challenges we ran intoüé¢

There were many challenges that we encountered while building the project like retrieving the face images from the camera and sending them to the server for processing, recognizing multiple faces in the same image. Initially, we were sending every captured image to the server for detection, but it was too costly by bandwidth, processing and it generated an alternative log for check-in check-out consequently until the user does not leave the frame. So we found a solution by using Google Vision API which will look for a face in the image and if there is a face available then and then only the image is sent to the server. So this was a game-changing optimation. The library we have used to Recognize Face is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/">face-recognition</a> which is used to Recognize faces from Python. It is built using <a href="http://dlib.net/">dlib‚Äôs</a> state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/">Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark</a>.


## Accomplishments that we're proud ofüéñ

Working Android App for Registering data of users like name, email, image of users with email authentication to Server [ to Django API ] which will store in the database, the App also shows the attendance logs of the Users and Statistics.

Working Android App for Monitoring the doors of the buildings/offices/rooms/colleges/lecture halls. It will capture the image of users and send it to the server for validation [ to Django API ] only when the face is visible inside the camera frame [ Thanks to Google vision API ], The Django API will compare the image with registered faces and generate the Attendance log in Firebase. The API returns a JSON response.

## What's next for üéØ

We don‚Äôt have any IOT device with us that‚Äôs why we had created an Android App for monitoring. In Future what we can do is, We can use an IOT device like Raspberry pi for Monitoring which will call the Django API. We can also have multiple devices for Monitoring at different gates/doors.

Advance Leave Ticket - Whenever any user is going to take a leave then he/she can put a ticket in advance the duration of leave along with the reason.

Push Notification - Whenever any user is expected to be at any organization and he/she is absent then a notification mechanism will alert the user of the event.


## What is required and How to run the System.

firebase Realtime Database

The firebase credentials JSON should be named as "mycreds.json" and placed in the Facerecognition folder[Project directory].
The URLS of the respected database should be updated in the Project.

You will also need the python and some additional packages.

#### Additional required packages

wheel

cmake

cv2

dlib

face_recognition

numpy

django

django-sslserverpickle

firebase_admin

shutil

Note :- If you get any error while installing dlib. Then Please Install Visual C++ tools for CMake in your Computer.

To run the server write following command in cmd [path:Project directory],

python manage.py runsslserver ip:8000

ip = The local ip given to your machine by the router.

to find ip use ipconfig command

Suppose my ip is 10.0.0.4 then type following

Example,
	
	python manage.py runsslserver 10.0.0.4:8000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now app stuff.....
For Apps( Monitoring and Admin), do clean gradle build. Every library used in respective app is available in build.gradle file(App level).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for Monitoring App,
we have used following libraries.
Google Vision for Mobile ( To detect face in live camera stream )
Retrofit( to send data to API)

for Admin App,
Following libraries are added,
Firebase-core, Firebase-realtime-Database ( Visit firebase for android documentation for more details :https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup )
Recyclerview.

Do clean bulid when you open the respective project. All libraries are used with stable version so most probably you will not face any issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change IP ADDRESS in RETROFIT base URL.
in Contactless_Attendance project: Go to : RetrofitClientInstance.java
You will found one static string variable named: BASE_URL
value mustbe in given format: "https://<your-ip-address>:8000/"
NOTE: ip-address must be same as you have given in django sslrunserver command.

Now, run both app, monitoring and admin,
show face in monitoring you will get realtime update in admin app without refresh.
